The likelihood of a new disease, DIVOC, can be predicted using a regression model that utilizes social media posts describing user symptoms, test results, and age. The regression model input features include:
1. AGE > 30:            User age is greater than 30 years old. If no age is provided, assume user age is less than 30 years old.
2. CHILLS:              User experiencing the symptom, chills. Example synonyms for chills include rigor, shivering, feeling cold, cold sweats, gooseflesh, cold sweats, night sweats, etc.
3. COUGH:               User experiencing the symptom, cough. Example synonyms for cough include coughing, hacking, etc.
4. HEADACHE:            User experiencing the symptom, headache. Example synonyms for headache include cephalalgia, migraine, head pain, head pressure, head throbbing, head discomfort, brain ache, etc.
5. CHEST PAIN:          User experiencing the symptom, chest pain. Example synonyms for chest pain include angina pectoris, pain in chest, chest hurts, chest discomfort, chest tightness, chest soreness, etc.
6. LOSS OF APPETITE:    User experiencing the symptom, loss of appetite. Example synonyms for loss of appetite include anorexia, appetite loss, not hungry, not interested in food, not wanting to eat, etc.

8. LOSS OF SMELL:        User experiencing the symptom, loss of smell. Example synonyms for loss of smell include anosmia, hyposmia, inability to smell, cannot smell anything, smell blindness, smell insensitivity, etc.

The feature weights for the regression model are:
1. AGE > 30:            0.44
2. CHILLS:              0.34
3. COUGH:               0.30
4. HEADACHE:            0.92
5. CHEST PAIN:          0.65
6. LOSS OF APPETITE:    0.24
7. LOSS OF TASTE:       0.35
8. LOSS OF SMELL:       0.17

The output should include a list of all the observed features and the sum of the feature weights (score). 

Examples:

1. POST:  Hi im triple mrna vaxxed but this is the 3rd time im getting covid. On previous infections i haven't experienced any serious symptoms but this time im having trouble. I just noticed when i lay on my bed im having trouble breathing but its better when i sit. Do you have any suggestions for this stage? Should i go to a hospital or wait to see if it will get worse or not?

Timeline:
*03/22 Throat swollen, runny nose, fever
*03/23 congestion gets worse and serious backpain, fever continues. Cant sleep at night due to fever
*03/24 only slept a couple hours. Woke up nauseous and i blacked out and collapsed after i got out of bed. I went to hospital and got my covid test. They gave me an iv and sent me home. My situation improved during day.
*03/25 woke up feeling better. Nose opened up but still lots of mucus when breathing. Throat is still hurting but its bearable. No fever, nausea or loss of smell. However I just realised when i went to bed and lie down im having trouble breathing. When i sit it feels better.

2. POST:  Just curious more than anything. Do different variants cause different symptoms? Is it possible to determine which variant you had based on the symptoms you experienced or other ways? I had COVID 4 weeks ago. My symptoms were: 
sore throat
coughing
congestion
fatigue
loss of appetite
muscle aches
chills but only a very low grade fever
diarrhea
insomnia

POST: I honestly thought I had a cold and was so surprised when the Covid test was positive. I couldnâ€™t believe it! But as the day has gone on - I am feeling reminiscent of my first infection in early November 2022. Iâ€™ve been doom scrolling Covid re-infection news. Figured Iâ€™d reach out to Reddit since it was an amazing support last time. I think Iâ€™m feeling less sick this time but itâ€™s hard to remember! Lungs are definitely more clear but I have bad sinus congestion. How was your 2nd infection? Was it more mild? I am hoping I kick its butt and Iâ€™m better in a few days ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž would love to hear yâ€™allâ€™s experiences.

POST: Tested positive for Covid for the first time. Iâ€™m vaccinated, though I was due for another booster and hadnâ€™t gotten around to it. My fault. Right now itâ€™s like the flu and itâ€™s bearable, except for the headache. Itâ€™s skull-splitting and constant, and Tylenol isnâ€™t even touching it. Has anyone had this, and any advice for getting some relief? Itâ€™s only day 2 but Iâ€™m miserable.

POST: Tested positive for the first time ever today. Yesterday woke up with fever, had the chills all day, fatigue, and a cough. Today I literally only have some brain fog, stuffy nose, and a much more mild cough compared to yesterday.

Hopefully the worst of it was yesterday because as today goes on I am feeling better.
