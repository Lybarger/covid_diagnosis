

The likelihood of a new disease, DIVOC, can be predicted using a regression model that utilizes social media posts describing user symptoms, test results, and age.

The regression model input features include:

1. COUGH: User experiencing the symptom, cough. Example synonyms for cough include cough, coughing, etc.
2. SORE THROAT: User experiencing the symptom, sore throat. Example synonyms for sore throat include sore throat, scratchy throat, throat hurting, inflamed throat, etc.
3. FEVER:  User experiencing the symptom, fever. Example synonyms for fever include fever, feverish, feeling hot, running a temperature, burning up, high temperature, etc.

The normalized feature weights for the regression model are:

1. COUGH: 0.48
2. SORE THROAT: 0.31
3. FEVER: 0.21

The output should include a list of all the observed features and the sum of the feature weights. 

Examples:

1. Post:  I have been coughing for three days and  my throat hurts so bad I can barely swallow.
Output: {'features': ['COUGH', 'SORE  THROAT'], 'likelihood': 0.79}

2. Post:  I came home sick from work yesterday because I was burning up. I have not been coughing but my throat is starting to hurt.
Output: {'features': ['FEVER', 'SORE  THROAT'], 'likelihood': 0.52}

3. Post:  I feel terrible. I feel nauseous and have diarrhea.
Output: {'features': [], 'likelihood': 0.00}



-----------------------------------------------------------

Post: I cannot believe I am this sick. I cannot stop coughing, my throat hurts so bad, and I am burning up.

Output: {'features': ['COUGH', 'SORE THROAT', 'FEVER'], 'likelihood': 1.0}

Post: I have been fatigued and itchy all day. I hope I get better soon. I hope I do not have DIVOC.

Output: {'features': [], 'likelihood': 0.00}

Post: I started with a sore throat and fatigue and body aches last Thursday, it has been coming and going from then to now and had a light cough occasionally. Yesterday was the worst so far with super fatigue and soreness, some weird breathing and sore lymphâ€™s in the groin, went to bed at 9am and slept 10 hours. A little better today but still sore and exhausted.

Output: Output: {'features': ['COUGH', 'SORE THROAT'], 'likelihood': 0.79}
