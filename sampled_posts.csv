uoy8kj,"The first time I had COVID was late Dec 2020 / Early Jan 2021, and Im currently recovering from my Second infection. Here are the most helpful things Ive learned along the way. * Once youre infected, if theres anyone else in your house (including spouse) try to remain as separate from one another as you can. (I realize thats hard if you have children - remember, this is just my experience) * If you have to prepare meals, wear a mask and gloves when doing so if its a common area. * Sanitize all surfaces as much and as frequently as you are physically able. * Wash bedsheets as much as you can. Especially if you have the night sweats. * Sleep propped up with pillows. This helps with drainage so things dont build up too much in your chest and sinuses while sleeping. * Increase your Multivitamin, Vit D3, C, and Zinc * Stay Hydrated, even when you think youre fine. This includes water, soups, decaf teas, cucumber, celery, etc * Get fresh air (even if just opening a window) for at least 15 minutes a day. * Do not become dependant on electronics.

s4p3ds,"40 F UNVACCINATED First case of Covid Made on throwaway account because I have been on this sub the last few days and y'all are mean sometimes lol. I had planned on getting vaccinated but was just waiting until my turn . Then the stories started from women my age group. As someone who suffers endometriosis and had heard negative effects on the menstrual cycle firsthand but was seeing the media and doctors deny and say there was zero side effects when I was seeing them IRL made me decide against. Yes, I know people who have died of Covid, I have many friends and family in Healthcare on the front lines. It's a baffling and cruel illness. I say this so that I can hope many of you will be able to understand that a lot of us that are hesitant are so because of the lack of transparency and what is now is seeming to be straight out lies. Many of you are so cruel and judgemental to previous unvaccinated sharers . I'm just trying to learn here and help others learn since we don't receive straight answers from any source it seems.

rujz6z,So I'm (27F) currently on holiday in Italy and I woke up yesterday on New years day feeling extremely run down. I wasn't sure if it was lack of sleep or chance I had covid. I am quadruple vaxed/double vaxed twice (2 AZ and 2 Pfizer) due to moving to Europe in the middle of the pandemic and not wanting to wait for them to figure out how to recognise non European vaccines. I am also booked to get my 5th shot/ booster next month. Symptoms today: - low grade fever - sore throat -my nose feels difficult to breathe through even though it's not actually blocked/lost sense of smell - tingling tastebuds - even more exhaustion to the point where walking 10m feels like a marathon. I realised these are all symptoms of covid. I also remembered that my tour guide on Wednesday was coughing and blowing his nose a lot and wasn't wearing a mask which made me wonder at the time whether he possibly had covid. Today I was told that someone else who was at the same bar as me on Wednesday tested positive to covid on Friday as there symptoms took a while to develop.,Presumed Positive,2022-01-02 16:32:49

That evening I still felt awful but much better than the morning. Same sleep issues. Same temp issues.

My sons have been with their father since the 25th. They showed no signs of sickness so they have stayed with him so that they don't get sick. My question I guess is... How do I know when it is safe to bring them home? I get them to and from school and they go back on Tuesday. What do I need to do to KNOW we aren't still contagious? This is our first time with Covid and im flying blind. The last thing I want to do is get my sons sick or send them to school and spread it further. I'm calling my doctor in the morning.",Presumed Positive,2022-01-03 06:06:05
w9q8ux,"Hi all i Im double vaxxed 22 f, I started feeling bad three days ago with a stiff neck and was a little nervous, then came the dry tickle cough and headache. Today Im super sore, have a fever that fluctuates between 98.2 and 100.2 and I have pretty bad nausea and intestinal issues as well as chest tightness and some pain, a high heart rate, and some dizziness.I have suspected POTS (previous to Covid) I took a pcr test and a rapid but Im just super nervous and scared. Ive been super careful this whole time, and my anxiety is through the roof does this sound like anyones experience??",Presumed Positive,2022-07-27 17:16:06
rtl56s,"My place of work is currently dealing with an active breakout, although I dont think Ive been in close contact with anyone who has COVID. I have to do a rapid test everyday before I go onsite. However yesterday while I was at work I got a PCR test and shortly after I started developing symptoms. I told my manager and I was sent home and was told to do another rapid test. My rapid test came back positive but this morning my PCR came back negative. I am still experiencing mild symptoms, however im not sure what to do from here.",Presumed Positive,2022-01-01 10:07:20
s66bao,"I keep hearing (and have been told by doctors) that you can test positive upwards of 90 days. We all had covid back in November. My child has a slight scratchy/itchy throat (allergy meds didn't seem to help). Is is possible that the test would come back positive, even if it's not covid? Or if it comes back positive, how can we truly know if Covid is causing these symptoms?",Presumed Positive,2022-01-17 10:17:06
tazxbw,"When should I test for Covid using my RAT tests? So on Saturday (5 days ago now) I saw my partner for about three to four hours at hers, no masks were worn as we both thought we both thought we were both negative from covid. The next day (Sunday 4 days ago) my partner messages me and tells me that she has tested positive to covid 19. Yesterday (4days from seeing my partner) I went and got a PCR test and also did a RAT, they both came back negative. Today (5 days since exposed) I did a RAT test in the morning and a RAT test just 20 minutes ago (its 10:03pm at night) and they are both negative. My question is when should I test again to find out if I actually have covid? When is the best time to get tested? Cheers in advance! :)",Presumed Positive,2022-03-10 09:29:09
yptr2b,"Hi there, has anyone experienced only fever with headache? Today I woke up feeling a bit under the weather, in the middle of the day I got hit by chills, fever and feeling of cold. 2 hours later headache joined. Is it possible that I have covid?

x4b6iu,"Link at bottom: I was exposed 12 days ago and have had all the hallmark symptoms for 7 days now. I keep getting negatives on the home tests, but todays test seems to have maybe the faintest gray line. If I hold my phone further away, the line becomes more apparent, I think?

st6uhz,"I did a covid test because I had a stuffy nose and a tickling sensation at the back of my throat. &amp;#x200B; The test came back, light positive. I did 2 more 2hours later and they are clean. &amp;#x200B; Considering ive got mild symptoms and i was on public transport full of unmasked people a day earlier and it was raining, \[i had a mask on\] &amp;#x200B; I guess i am in the very early stages of it being in me, \[Single vaxxed too\], I guess the only real way to find out is to do a send-off test.",Presumed Positive,2022-02-15 11:27:28
zgeoon,"How do you tell if your at home testing kits are broken or expired...? I'm vaccinated and had 2 boosters, so 4 shots total. Had covid in Dec'21, so have some antibodies hopefully. I've used around 8 at home testing kits all of which say I'm positive over the past 3 dats, but went to a mobile testing site yesterday for a rapid/PCR both of which returned negative. I went again to a different site this AM to do both tests and the rapid once again returned negative. 2nd round of PCR results will be back tomorrow most likely. I will be doing daily pcr tests until Sunday since I will be visiting Hong Kong where they test you on arrival...",Presumed Positive,2022-12-08 17:52:52
s53lm0,I am waiting test results but pretty sure I have omicron. Double vaxxed and boosted. A couple of days of slight achiness and just body heavy and fatigued. One interesting thing is the site on my arm where I got my booster is really sore - it feels just like after I got the vaccine a month ago. Anyone else have this?,Presumed Positive,2022-01-15 23:35:52
s7mu15,I keep getting these horrible headaches and I feel emotionally numb. Its hard to explain but my energy feels very off and I dont feel like myself at all. Its also difficult for me to stay awake so I spend the majority of the day sleeping. My body aches have been on and off as well. Has anyone else experienced this?,Presumed Positive,2022-01-19 05:04:02
