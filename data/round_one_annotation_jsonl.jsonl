They said my lungs were good and my oxygen was good. Should I be concerned about why my cough is wet? I have what feels like post nasal drip and mucus in my throat. It starts to come up with my coughs very occasionally but mostly just sits there stubbornly. It makes my throat feel like I need to cough but I get no relief from coughing. The ticking sensation comes right back. I don't have a runny or stuffy nose. Breathing seems fine but the irritation cuts off my voice when I talk. Day 6. I'm feeling better otherwise and my husband has had this phlegm too. Confused.", "flair": "Tested Positive - Me", "time": "2022-05-30 09:04:57"}

Monday I had body aches and headaches, Tuesday increased body aches, sore throat, and I tested positive. Wednesday some shortness of breath, sore throat, exhaustion. The last two days the body aches have eased, but I am having intense sneezing fits, burning sinuses, congestion. Is this part of the course of the illness? I'm vaccinated and boosted and chose not to take paxlovid. I would think this is just allergies now, it is peak pollen time, but I'm taking 3 different allergy medications without improvement (Allegra, zyrtec, and hydroxyzine) and my allergies are usually mild.", "flair": "Tested Positive - Me", "time": "2022-05-27 09:58:40"}
{"id": "yyjqxx", "text": "So today is day 8 since I first tested positive and approximately day 12 since I started noticing symptoms. Anyways I took a test at day 5, and it was purple and instant. I took another one yesterday at day 7, and it may have been the darkest one yet. Instantly a thick, dark, grayish purple. I took another test exactly 24 hours later this morning, and while it showed pretty quickly, it was pink, not purple, and not as thick. Does the color change from purple to pink mean anything? Am I finally getting closer to testing negative?", "flair": "Tested Positive - Me", "time": "2022-11-18 08:11:46"}

It looked like the indicator was drawn on with a sharpie. Took a 2nd one, same thing. Diarrhea kicked in! Coughed too hard..had an accident. Followed by an emptying. 6/10 today my fever broke. I still ache all over and my cough has gone from very productive to dry and painful. Also, I seem to cough in succession and basically pass out and get dizzy from coughing. Can't sleep because if I lay down, or even lean back in a recliner, I immediately cough with every inhale. Also, WHAT IS UP WITH THIS FUCKING COTTONMOUTH? I'm nervous AF right now.

I want to put my timeline here so if anyone feels similar we can get through this together. Day 1 (Tues?) Is when I think my body decided I had caught it. I remember feeling mildly queasy but it was a completely normal day other than that. Day 2 - I felt like death. Killer headache, dry throat, woozy and dizzy, body fatigue, could barely leave bed. Delirious and hallucinating at night, sleep was difficult. Temperature going nuts, running a fever. Day 3 - Started off very similar, got some meds (ibuprofen and lemsip) in me and then had a 3 hour drive as a passenger to get through. During that drive I perked up a bit and felt slightly better. That evening I still felt awful but much better than the morning. Same sleep issues. Same temp issues. Day 4 - Felt slightly better, most symptoms more manageable but the remaining ones were causing havoc on me mentally. Headache completely gone, not as woozy, still burning up a lot and having trouble eating.

I have fever (gets high if I dont bring it down with Tylenol, 99-100) dry cough, sore throat, scratchy throat, clogged sinuses, headache, body pains and some nausea and weakness. Today I have some tingling in the lungs. My covid home test today was negative, which is super wad accurate. I am half dose vaxxed since I got a reaction and couldnt continue. I also got covid first in 2020, then 2021 and recovered with some long haul symptoms. Are these symptoms similar to omicron? Should I worry, and get PcR test or wait to recover? I take all type of vitamins, D, Z, C, quercetin, turmeric, ginger, fish oil, magnesium and oregano oil. I take Tylenol to control fever. I rest in best most of the day and sleep.
